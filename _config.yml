  Hi! I'm Mukul Sauhta, a driven fourth-year Computer Science student at North Carolina State University, specializing in software engineering, data engineering, and full-stack development. My passion lies in building efficient, scalable systems and tackling complex technical challenges through projects that blend creativity and technical expertise. Recently, I worked as a Data Engineer Intern at Perdis AI LLC, where I enhanced data monitoring capabilities through cutting-edge tools like PySpark and Delta Lake.
