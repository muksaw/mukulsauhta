# Aspiring Software/Data Engineer

#### Hello! I'm Mukul, a driven fourth-year [Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), specializing in software engineering, data engineering, and full-stack development. <br>   <br>  I love building efficient, scalable systems and tackling complex technical challenges through projects that blend creativity and technical expertise. <br>   <br>    Recently, I worked as a Data Engineer Intern at Perdis AI LLC, where I enhanced data monitoring capabilities through cutting-edge tools like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) and [Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html).  <br>    <br>   I am also deeply involved in web development and backend infrastructure, having contributed to the creation and maintenance of multiple [high-performing websites](https://beesbridge.us/), but I hope to only improve my skills in these fields. <br>   <br>   Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy swimming, reading, and heavy weightlifting.

## Education
- B.S., Computer Science NCSU (_Expected May 2025_)

## Work Experience
**Data Engineer Intern @ Perdis AI LLC (_June 2024 - August 2024_)**

**Full-Stack Developer @ Beesbridge LLC (_December 2022 - Present_)**

## Projects
### Multi-Platform Streaming Monitor
Developed a Chrome extension using **JavaScript**, **Twitch API**, and **YouTube API** to monitor the live status of 100 streamers.

### CoffeeMaker Simulation
Contributed to unit testing and frontend layout improvements for a coffee recipe management system using **Java**, **Maven**, and **JUnit**.

### CUDA-Accelerated Vector Calculation
Implemented a CUDA algorithm in **C** for parallel processing to optimize performance in vector magnitude calculations.

### Beesbridge LLC Website
Created and maintained a website for a boutique data engineering company using WordPress.
Integrated custom HTML and CSS to extend WordPress functionality, ensuring the site’s standout design.

### Data Observability Tool for Profile and Drift Metrics
Developed an open-source tool with PySpark to enhance data monitoring by implementing profile and drift metrics that aggregate, reformat, and analyze large incoming datasets incrementally.
Generated detailed visualizations and dashboards of big data through profiling metrics such as quantile distributions, frequent items, and numerous statistical calculations, which detect data drifts.

### Data Engineering: Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2
Implemented SCD Type 2 to track historical changes in dimensional data, ensuring full visibility of past data states for reliable analysis.
Utilized Delta Lake, PySpark, and SQL to efficiently manage records by merging new data with existing datasets and tracking changes using dynamic updates and versioning.

### TrailManager
Created a “Trail Manager” tool using Java to analyze and optimize paths between nodes representing campsites or checkpoints in a wilderness setting.
Applied breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to find the most efficient routes, reducing travel time and resource consumption.

### AES Encryption and Decryption (C, Makefile)
Implemented an encryption and decryption tool using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), ensuring secure data transmission and storage.
Developed the tool in C, optimizing it for performance and large files, with a Makefile for easy compilation and deployment.
