# Aspiring Software/Data Engineer

#### Hello! I'm Mukul, a driven fourth-year [Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), specializing in software engineering, data engineering, and full-stack development. <br>  I love building efficient, scalable systems and tackling complex technical challenges through projects that blend creativity and technical expertise. <br>  Recently, I worked as a Data Engineer Intern at Perdis AI LLC, where I enhanced data monitoring capabilities through cutting-edge tools like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) and [Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html). I am also deeply involved in web development and backend infrastructure, having contributed to the creation and maintenance of multiple [high-performing websites](https://beesbridge.us/), but I hope to only improve my skills in these fields. <br>  Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy swimming, reading, and heavy weightlifting.
